Case Study:
  Study of Kafka performance using Locust.io.
  Using Django and Flask for API request from Locut to Kafka server.
  Checking Behaviour in distributed environment.
  Controlling number of producer, consumer using API request
  Controlling number of broker using API
  
 Observation:
  High Scalability of Kafka Server.
  Bottlenack was decide with the network channel capability.
  Django API performance was better than Flask API performance(may be due to single thread environment in Flask).
